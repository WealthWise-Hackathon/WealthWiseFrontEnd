**How to run:**
1. The MySQL workbench database may be local so if it does not work connect to your own database by changing these in `application.properties` to your own:
```java
spring.datasource.url=
spring.datasource.username=
spring.datasource.password=
``` 
And also change the database connection by going to database and putting your url, username and password

2. Either press the green play button or press shift+f10

3. Either use a preexisting login or create on with the register button then login after registering

4. You are on the home page and can now explore all the other pages
